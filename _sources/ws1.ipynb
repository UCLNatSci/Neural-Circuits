    "Given a graph, we would like to be able to answer various questions: Do two graphs have the same structure?  Is there a path from node X to node Y? What is the minimum length path from node X to node Y? To answer these questions, we need a way to represent the graph in a computer. There are three main ways to represent a graph: edge list, adjacency list and adjacency matrix.\n",

    "A **walk** in a graph is a sequence of nodes formed by following edges. A walk may visit the same node several times. For example, in the egg-laying graph $[1, 3, 7, 6]$ is a walk from node 1 to node 6, and $[1,2,1,3]$ is a walk from node 1 to node 3.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Shortest Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two nodes in a directed graph, there may be zero, one or multiple paths between them. The **path distance** from node $v_i$ to node $v_j$ is the length of the shortest path connecting $v_i$ to $v_j$. In this section we will build an algorithm which calculates the path distance between nodes, using a technique called breadth first search.\n",

    "1. Label every unlabelled node directly connected by an edge from a distance-1 node with a distance of 2.\n",

    "## Breadth First Search\n",

    "A search algorithm is a method of traversing a graph by following edges. In **breadth first search** (BFS), we start at the origin node and traverse the graph in levels, increasing the distance from the origin one level at a time.\n",

Finally, we visit node 2 which is the direct neighbour of nodes 4, 5 and 6. The output of the breadth first search is $[1, 3, 7, 4, 5, 6, 2]$.\n",
