**Motif Analysis**

## Background

A motif is a subgraph with a particular topological configuration, and the aim of motif analysis is to determine which specific motifs recur in a network with a frequency that is significantly greater than chance. Any motifs that meet this criterion are thought to represent important building blocks of the network. For example, motif analysis has revealed functionally important features in the nervous systems of the macaque, cat and *C. elegans* {cite:p}`sporns2004motifs`.

In a recent study, the connectome of a large part of the Drosophila Melanogaster nervous system was published, but a motif analysis has yet to be completed.

## Project Brief

You should perform a motif analysis of the connectome of *Drosophila Melanogaster*. By reviewing relevant scientific literature, investigate how motif analysis can be performed in nervous systems, then apply appropriate techniques to the *Drosophila Melanogaster* connectome detailed in {cite:p}`xu2020connectome`. Using diagrams and equations, clearly describe how the motif analysis is performed.
