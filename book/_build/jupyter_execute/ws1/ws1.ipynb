    "A **graph** is a collection of **nodes** (or **vertices**) connected by **edges**. In the following example, which represents part of the egg-laying circuit of C-Elegans, nodes represent neurons and edges represent synaptic connections between them:\n",

    "Graph\n",
    ": A graph $G = (V, E)$ is a set of nodes $V = \\{v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n\\}$ and edges $E = \\{(v_i, v_j), \\dots\\}$ where $(v_i, v_j)$ is an edge joining nodes $v_i$ and $v_j$.\n",

    "Order\n",
    ": The order of a graph $G$ is number of nodes in $G$.\n",

    "Directed Graph\n",
    ": A directed graph (or digraph) is a graph where each edge $(v_i, v_j)$ has an associated direction from $v_i$ to $v_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple Graph\n",
    ": A simple graph is a graph which does not have any loops (edges from a node to itself) or multiple edges (two edges joining the same two nodes in the same direction).\n",

    "## Graph Representations\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a graph, we would like to be able to answer various questions: Do two graphs have the same structure?  Is there a path from node X to node Y? What is the minimum length path from node X to node Y? To answer these questions, we need a way to represent the graph in a computer. There are three main ways to represent a graph: edge list, adjacency list and adjacency matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Definitions\n",
    "Edge List\n",
    ": An edge list consists of a list of pairs of numbers, one pair for each edge. The numbers represent the starting and ending nodes of each edge. Here is the edge list corresponding to the egg-laying graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$[1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 1], [2, 4], [3, 4], [3, 5],\\\\\n",
    "[3, 7], [5, 4], [6, 4], [6, 7], [7, 3], [7, 4], [7, 6]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a directed graph, the order that we write the pair $[i, j]$ is important, but the order that we write the list of pairs is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjacency List\n",
    ": An adjacency list consists of a sequence of lists. The list at position $i$ contains all the nodes which node $i$ connects to. Here is the adjacency list corresponding to the egg-laying graph:\n",
