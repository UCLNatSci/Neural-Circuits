What is the minimum length path from node X to node Y? To answer these questions, we need a way to represent the graph in a computer. There are three main ways to represent a graph: edge list, adjacency list and adjacency matrix.\n",

    "The **degree** of a node is defined as the edges which connect to the node.\n",

    "For a directed graph, the **indegree** and **outdegree** of a node is defined as the number of incoming and outgoing connections respectively.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The **distance matrix** of a graph is the matrix [$d_{ij}$] where $d_{ij}$ is the path distance from node $i$ to node $j$. If $i=j$ then $d_{ij} =0$, and if $i$ and $j$ are not connected then $d_{ij}$ is infinite. The **average path length** is the mean of the finite off-diagonal elements of the distance matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an undirected graph, the distance matrix is symmetrical.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **clustering coefficient** of a node $\\gamma(\\mu)$ measures how many edges exist between a node’s neighbours, where the $n$ **neighbours** of a node $\\mu$ are the nodes directly connected to $\\mu$ in either direction. The nodes’s clustering coefficient is defined as the ratio of actually existing connections between the $n$ neighbours and the maximal number of such connections possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a directed graph, if the $n$ neighbours are connected to each other by $m$ directed edges, then the clustering coefficient is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\gamma(\\mu) = m/(n^2 −n).$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that the clustering coefficient does not exist for nodes that have fewer than 2 neighbours.\n",
