Use NetworkX to estimate the global clustering coefficient and average path length of $G_{10,0.5}$.\n2. Write a function which returns an undirected random graph with $N$ nodes and expected (average) node degree $k$.\n2. For fixed average node degree $k$, how does average path length and global clustering vary with graph size? Choose a value of $k$, and plot average path length against $N$ and global clustering against $N$. Describe what you find.\n\n","pos":4,"type":"cell"}
